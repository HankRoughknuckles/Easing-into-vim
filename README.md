This is a simple vimrc file to help you ease the transition into using Vim.

Some things to remember:
  -This allows you the same basic hotkeys that most other text editors have,
  EXCEPT that you'd use <Space> instead of Ctrl
    (Note: these should be performed when in normal mode)
    Examples:
      Open = <Space>o   (select the file in the window that opens and press enter)
      New  = <Space>n
      Save = <Space>s
      Quit = <Space>q

  -Change tabs like in most other editors using <Ctrl-Tab> and <Ctrl-Shift-Tab>

  -Open fuzzy file searching with <Space>f (think "fuzzy" as the keyword to remember)
    -Note, this might be slow if you open vim in a big directory. You can
    overcome this by going to the directory you want in terminal and using the mvim
    command there (or gvim if not on mac)
