A .vimrc to help you transition into Vim
=============================

Some things to remember:
----------------------
  
- Opening and Saving *(just like other text editors, but use `<Space>` instead of `<Ctrl>`)*

      -   Open = `<Space>o`   (select the file in the window that opens and press enter)

      -   New  = `<Space>n`

      -   Save = `<Space>s`

      -   Quit = `<Space>q`

-   Change tabs like in most other editors using `<Ctrl-Tab>` and `<Ctrl-Shift-Tab>`

-   Open fuzzy file searching with `<Space>f` (think "fuzzy" as the keyword to remember)
    
      -   Note, this might be slow if you open vim in a big directory. 

      -   You can overcome this by going to the directory you want in terminal and using the `mvim` command there (or `gvim` if not on mac)
