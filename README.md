This is a simple vimrc file to help you ease the transition into using Vim.

Some things to remember:
  -This allows you the same basic hotkeys that most other text editors have, EXCEPT that you'd use <Space> instead of Ctrl
    (Note: these should be performed when in normal mode)
    Examples:
      Open = <Space>o   (select the file in the window that opens and press enter)
      New  = <Space>n
      Save = <Space>s
      Quit = <Space>q

  -Change tabs like with most other editors using <Ctrl-Tab> and <Ctrl-Shift-Tab>
